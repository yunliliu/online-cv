      Build a campus dormitory management system using C# with partners to effectively save manpower and material resources, protect campus dormitory water and electricity safety, and improve school logistics management Adopting B/S architecture
       Using SQL Server as the back-end database and HTML CSS as the front-end development tool, the system realizes the necessary functions such as system maintenance, dormitory management, student management, dormitory allocation, information query, etc. Its operation is simple, the interface is friendly, and the operation is relatively stable

                  Searched for packages with similar names based on the pattern and checked the metadata of the inputted package, we analyzed 216, 548 packages from PyPI as of October 26, 2021, and 1077 of them are malicious package
                  Processed PyPI packages with known source code repositories and identified packages possibly created for squatting attacks
                  Studied the logs generated by the package installation to figure out the vital parts for the developers. leveraged dynamic analysis technique to generate concise installation behavior logs"
